# Javascript and classes
JavaScript does have classes. This feature was introduced with the ECMAScript 2015
specification (often referred to as ES6). However, it's important to note that JavaScript is
primarily a prototype-based language, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over
existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. In other words, it provides a more familer
syntax for developers coming from class-based languages such as Java or C++, but under
hood it works somewhat differently.
